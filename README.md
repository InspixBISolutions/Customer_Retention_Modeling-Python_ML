Customer Retention Modeling | Scholastic Travel Company (STC) | Inspix BI Solutions

üéì Project Overview

This project showcases how Inspix BI Solutions applies advanced analytics and machine learning to help businesses understand and improve customer retention. For the Scholastic Travel Company (STC), we developed a predictive model to identify key factors driving customer churn and retention, enabling the company to take proactive actions.

üè¢ Business Context

STC organizes educational travel programs for students and relies heavily on repeat business. Retaining schools and groups is critical to its sustainability and growth. Understanding which factors contribute to repeat bookings helps optimize marketing efforts, improve customer experience, and reduce churn.

üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed records of STC‚Äôs customer bookings:

School demographics

Trip details

Financial variables (trip costs, payments)

Repeat booking status (target variable)

Data was imported from an Excel workbook with multiple exhibits and required cleaning to remove irrelevant rows and handle missing values.

üéØ Project Objectives

Explore and clean customer booking data.

Engineer features relevant to customer retention.

Build a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of repeat bookings.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

Visualize important variables and provide actionable insights.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas (data handling)

numpy (numerical operations)

scikit-learn (modeling & evaluation)

matplotlib & seaborn (visualizations)
